# CS573-Data-Visualization
My assignments and exams from the course **CS573: Data Visualization** at WPI.

I took this course in **Spring 2024** offered by Prof. Lane Harrison
The coursework included:
- 3 Assignments/Mini Projects  
- 14 Reflections - Reading about different research on Data Visualization and writing 10 sentences on it.  
- 1 Final Project

For a course overview : No special material was given, the course was totally self learning, nothing special was taught in the course. Classes used to be nothing but only discussions. Instead of this course you can pay for youtube premium for 4 months, learn 'Data Visualization' there and have a trip to Hawaii and still can save some money for next term !

Kindly note the all submissions were from Professor's forked repos of github(that was the standard submission) hence all assignments are not in the single repository, you can find them below
